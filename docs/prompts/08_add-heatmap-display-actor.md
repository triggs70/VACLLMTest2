Add an actor called AHeatMapDisplayActor. On BeginPlay it should: Resolve ProjectDir/Data/shots.csv, use UShotDataLoader to LoadCsvToShots and NormalizeShotsToUV, use UHeatmapGenerator to build a UTexture2D heatmap, create a dynamic material instance from a BaseMaterial and set a texture param named "HeatTex", assign the MID to a UStaticMeshComponent (PlaneMesh). Put all files in the appropriate locations in the directory, and expose: UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) FString CsvPathRel = "Data/shots.csv", UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) UMaterialInterface* BaseMaterial, UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere) UStaticMeshComponent* PlaneMesh
