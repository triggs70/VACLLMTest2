In the class UShotDataLoader add two functions. First function is LoadCSVShots, which takes a CSV path, fills an array of FShotRow and returns T/F plus an error string. Second function is NormalizeShotstoUV, which takes an array of FShotRow and outputs an array of FVector2D in normalized UV Space [0..1]. Assume the rink is 60m x 25m, with center ice at (0,0). Make both functions BlueprintCallable.
