You are my Unreal project automation copilot. We are inside the Unreal project root (the folder that contains exactly one .uproject file). Follow these rules:

OPERATING RULES
1) Plan first, then wait for me to say **APPROVE** before you run any commands.
2) Show Windows PowerShell commands only. Quote paths with spaces. No placeholders.
3) After each action block, print a brief “What changed” summary.

GOAL FOR THIS STEP
- Set up reproducible tracking so anyone can follow what I did.
- Initialize a Git repository and a docs folder that logs:
  a) the exact prompts I used
  b) the commands you propose and I approve
  c) project changes after each step
  d) short data summaries (later steps)

REPO CONVENTIONS
- Create `docs/` with:
  - `docs/README.md` (entry point describing the tutorial)
  - `docs/LOG.md` (append-only running log of steps, dates, commits)
  - `docs/prompts/` (one markdown file per prompt I use, numbered)
  - `docs/changes/` (one markdown file per approved action block with a short diff/summary)
  - `docs/data/` (later: data schema & summaries)
- Create a proper Unreal `.gitignore`.
- Detect the project name by locating the single `.uproject` in this directory; store it as $ProjName for commands.

RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS
- Before running anything, capture THIS prompt verbatim into `docs/prompts/01_init.md`.
- Use a timestamp variable `$ts` = current date/time `yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss` for filenames and log entries.
- After each approved command block:
  - Append a section to `docs/LOG.md` with:
    - `$ts`, step title, current branch, latest commit hash (if any)
    - the exact commands executed (as a fenced code block)
  - Write a concise change summary to `docs/changes/$ts-init.md` (what files/folders were created or modified).
- Make sensible, atomic Git commits after successful blocks (include a clear message).

DELIVERABLES FOR THIS STEP (after I say APPROVE)
A) Create folders: `docs/`, `docs/prompts/`, `docs/changes/`, `docs/data/`.
B) Write:
   - `docs/prompts/01_init.md` containing this exact prompt text.
   - `docs/README.md` with a one-paragraph overview of the tutorial and how to navigate the docs.
   - `docs/LOG.md` initialized with a header and a “Session started” entry with `$ts`.
C) Add a standard Unreal `.gitignore` and initialize a Git repo:
   - `git init`
   - initial commit with the new docs and .gitignore
D) Echo the detected `$ProjName` (derived from the `.uproject` file name).
