Fix the build errors in HeatMapGenerator.cpp Unreal Engine 5.6 no longer allows direct access to UTexture2D::PlatformData. Update the code so it uses HeatMapTexture->GetPlatformData()->Mips[0] instead, locking/unlocking BulkData and calling UpdateResource(). Make sure Pixels (FColor array) is copied correctly into the mip and the texture is created as PF_B8G8R8A8. Only change the parts needed to fix the errors, dont rewrite unrealated code.
