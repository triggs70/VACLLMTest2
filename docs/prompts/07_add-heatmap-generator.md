Create a new class UHeatMapGenerator. It should take a list of UV points, FVector2D and turn them into a UTexture2D heatmap. The steps for this are to: Create a 512x256 float grid, bind the UV points into the grid, apply a simple horizontal + vertical blur, normalize values to [0..1] with optional log scale, write into a UTexture2D (grayscale for now), and return the texture. Put this class in HeatMapGenerator .h and .cpp files.
